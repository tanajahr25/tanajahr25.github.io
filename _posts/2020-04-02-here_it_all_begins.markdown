I hate going to work everyday. I hate having to get up and clock into my job everyday, and here is where I start to change that. I hated going to college and taking so many unneccesary classes that had nothing to do with my major. I couldn't understand why it would take me 4 years to get my degree when I know for a fact there were other ways to get where I wanted to be, in a much faster way. Then I was told about flatiron... Since I've been using flatiron I've learned more about coding in a week here than a month at college. I know that I love to travel and I know that with becoming a software engineer that would be able to still happen. I have no desire to have to go into a office everyday. Yes I know meetings have to get done and I would have to go into the office some days, but I don't wanna go into a job everyday. I want to be able to work from home or work from the road, or vacation, or wherever I am. I know that what I want is possible and that I will make it happen. So here I am starting my journey...
